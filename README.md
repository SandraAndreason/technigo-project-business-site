# Business Site

The assignment was to build a buisness site with a header with responsive image and a signup form. 
I approached the task by getting inspiration from the sample sites and by going back and watching videos. 
I used flexbox, box-sizing and the techniques to do the form layout. 
I tried to insert a video instead of the imagen but I didnt really got it to work.
